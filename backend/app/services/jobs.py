"""In-process job orchestration: store + background worker.

Design for v1 (single-process, concurrency-safe):
  * A dict `_jobs` maps job_id -> JobStatus, mutated only inside an asyncio.Lock
    so concurrent GETs and the background task never clobber each other.
  * `create_job()` immediately returns a job_id and schedules the heavy work as
    an asyncio background task. Nothing heavy (clone/LLM/build) ever blocks the
    request/response cycle.
  * Each job stages through the JobStage enum and pushes JobEvents to the hub.

Concurrency rule: NO shared mutable state crosses jobs. Each task gets its own
RepoSnapshot (temp dir) and its own local variables. `_jobs` only holds records.
